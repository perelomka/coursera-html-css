        <p class="title">Ragdoll</p>
        <p class="description">The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes.
            They are large and muscular semi-longhair cats with a soft and silky coat.
            Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, they are best known
            for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature.
            The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the
            original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.

            Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States,
            ragdoll cats often are known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats" due to behaviors
            such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease when physically handled,
            and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets. </p>

    <div id="bengal" class="article col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <p class="title">Bengal</p>
        <p class="description"> The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic
            cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis).
            The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

            Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their Leopard Cat ancestry,
            and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are
            an energetic breed which needs much exercise and play. The earliest mention of an Asian leopard
            cat Ã— domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in Our Cats and All About Them.
            The next recorded mention of an Asian Leopard Cat x domestic cat cross was in a 1924 Belgian scientific
            journal.

    <div id="persian" class="article col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
        <p class="title">Persian</p>
        <p class="description"> The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its
            round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair"
            in the English-speaking countries. In the Middle East region, they are
            widely known as "Shirazi cats" and in Iran they are known as "Shiraz cat".
            The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from
            Iran (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620. Recognized by the
            cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English,
            and then mainly by American breeders after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations'
            breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair. </p>
