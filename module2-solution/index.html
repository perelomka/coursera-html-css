            <p class="description">The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes.
                They are large and muscular semi-longhair cats with a soft and silky coat.
                Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, they are best known
                for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature.
                The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the
                original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. </p>

            <p class="title">Bengal</p>
            <p class="description"> The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic
                cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis).
                The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

                Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their Leopard Cat ancestry,
                and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling.

            <p class="title">Persian</p>
            <p class="description"> The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its
                round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair"
                in the English-speaking countries. In the Middle East region, they are
                widely known as "Shirazi cats" and in Iran they are known as "Shiraz cat".
                The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from
                Iran (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620.
